# Introduction

Stylistic analysis is a synthesis of literature, linguistics, and computational methods, offering a
subtle understanding of authors’ expressive choices and narrative techniques. In our project,
we aimed to compare the stylistic elements in the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Sheridan Le
Fanu with his contemporaries from a quantitative point of view.
Through an examination of past research and as explained previously in the proposal, we
established a foundation for our inquiry, outlining the theoretical support that informs our
methodological approach to examine stylistic elements within an author’s writings by utilizing
computational tools and statistical analyses. Our methodology encompasses corpus
compilation and statistical analyses aimed at discerning linguistic features indicative of Poe’s
and Le Fanu’s authorial sign. We examined specific linguistic parameters such as sentence
structure, part-of-speech frequencies, point-of-view etc. preferences across Poe’s and Le
Fanu’s corpus and comparative dataset.
